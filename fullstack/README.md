# Full Stack Web Application with Django, React, Terraform, AWS and Gitlab


This project is a boilerplate to launch a full stack web application with
Django backend and React frontend to AWS Fargate (or EC2) and ECS containers
using Terraform cloud orchestration platform. Gitlab is used to push the 
project to AWS servers with its CI/CD actions. Vagrant is used to build local
virtual machine for developers to work on project and connecting to the 
bastion development server. 


I worked on this project a while ago, so some codes could be outdated, such
as those Terraform files. I don't intend to make changes to this project
any time soon unless I have to. After all, this is just a boilerplate for 
full stack web application.
