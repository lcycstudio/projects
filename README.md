# Projects

This repository contains projects that I did in the past.
These projects could be either a full stack web application or a
file pertaining a specific task. I will occassionally update this
repository with new contents (projects in the past).

#### Disclaimer

Most of the codes I wrote in the past are immature and rudimentary. I put these
past projects here with the intention to showcase what I did and what I know,
and I can feel your discomfort in seeing naive codes because they could be
better than that. I appreicate your concern. Honestly, I don't really want to 
improve the projects I did a long time ago, as long as we can understand what
they mean. For new projects that I did recently, I will follow the coding
standard to the best of my ability and make improvement along the way.


#### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly. \
Explicit is better than implicit. \
Simple is better than complex. \
Complex is better than complicated. \
Flat is better than nested. \
Sparse is better than dense. \
Readability counts. \
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. \
Although practicality beats purity. \
Errors should never pass silently. \
Unless explicitly silenced. \
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. \
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. \
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. \
Now is better than never. \
Although never is often better than *right* now. \
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. \
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. \
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
